      <h3>FALCON HEAVY</h3>
      <p>
        Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a
        factor of two. With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons
        (141,000 lb) Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the
        next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy. Falcon Heavy is
        composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines
        together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal
        to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft.
